# Reilly Seeley | Graduate Research Portfolio

This Github Portfolio contains selected projects from my M.S. in Geography & Geospatial Science program at Oregon State University.  
These works highlight the technical, analytical, and problem-solving skills I developed and applied throughout my graduate studies, including:

- **Programming & Scripting:** R, JavaScript (Google Earth Engine), and Python.
- **GIS & Remote Sensing:** Spatial analysis, geoprocessing, and visualization using ArcGIS Pro, Google Earth Engine, and spatial R packages.
- **Scientific Methodology:** Applying geographic perspectives to design original research workflows that investigate how people interact with their environment, from conceptual framing to spatial and statistical analysis, and interpreting results within both environmental and social contexts.
- **Data Handling:** Managing and analyzing large geospatial and time-series datasets.
- **Communication:** Writing technical reports, creating publication-quality graphics, and presenting research findings.
- **Collaboration & Independence:** Coordinating with research teams, engaging stakeholders, and solving complex problems independently.

## Projects

### 1. Satellite Image Analysis â€” Wildfire Impacts on Snowpack & M4 Forecasting
This project, completed in **GEOG 581: Satellite Image Analysis** and in collaboration with my graduate research assistantship, used the 2003 B&B Complex Fire in Oregon as a case study to investigate how wildfire-altered snowpack conditions influenced water supply forecasts from the USDA NRCS [Multi-Model Machine-Learning Metasystem (M<sup>4</sup>)](https://github.com/nrcs-nwcc/M4).  

By combining multiple satellite-derived burn severity metrics with M4 outputs, I evaluated how a single wildfire-affected SNOTEL record can bias basin-scale streamflow predictions when post-fire snow dynamics diverge from pre-fire norms.

**Key Applications:**
- Google Earth Engine scripting (JavaScript) for processing Landsat and MODIS imagery.
- Integrating satellite indices (NDVI, NDSI) with model outputs.
- Data masking, cloud removal, and composite creation.
- Producing reproducible workflows with exportable results.

**Repo Folder:** [`Satellite-Image-Analysis-OSU`](https://github.com/Reilly-Seeley/Geospatial-Work/tree/main/Satellite-Image-Analysis-OSU)  
**Includes:**  
- Graduate project report
- Four GEE scripts for NDVI change, FIRMS active fire detections, CBI burn severity mapping, and NDSI snow analysis.
- Usage and data disclaimers.

### 2. M.S. Capstone Project - Citizen Science Observer Engagement in the Colorado MRoS Study
This research was conducted in partnership with the NASA-Funded **Mountain Rain or Snow (MRoS)** Citizen Science Initiative (https://www.rainorsnow.org/home) and examined factors influencing long-term volunteer engagement in observer precipitation phase monitoring.  
Survey data and observation patterns were analyzed to identify behavioral and spatial differences between highly active and less-engaged observers, with the goal of informing strategies to improve data continuity.

**Core Finding:** Sustained participation over time, even at modest reporting frequencies, proved to be a stronger indicator of an engaged observer than high short-term activity. Both highly active and less-engaged participants shared similar survey attitudes and event reminder response rates, suggesting that the peak winter months, when precipitation phase monitoring is most relevant, present a key opportunity to reinforce engagement and extend active involvement.

**Key Applications:**
- Advanced R programming for data cleaning, spatial analysis, and statistical testing.
- GIS-based spatial clustering analysis (ArcGIS Pro and R spatial packages).
- Visualization of engagement metrics and survey results.
- Integration of Theory of Planned Behavior constructs into citizen science research.

**Repo Folder:** [`M.S.-Capstone-Project`](https://github.com/Reilly-Seeley/Geospatial-Work/tree/main/M.S.-Capstone-Project)  
**Includes:**  
- Full capstone project report
- Zipped archive of 15 R scripts with documentation of purpose and usage.
